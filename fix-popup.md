# ðŸ”§ Fixing the Popup Display Issue

## Steps to Fix:

### 1. Reload the Extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Clean Amazon Search"
3. Click the refresh icon (ðŸ”„) on the extension card
4. OR: Toggle the extension off and on again

### 2. Test the Popup
1. Click the extension icon in toolbar
2. The popup should now display properly with:
   - Header with title and toggle switch
   - Statistics section
   - Filter controls
   - Page disable button

### 3. If Still Not Working - Check Console
1. Right-click the extension icon
2. Select "Inspect popup"
3. Check the Console tab for errors
4. Look for:
   - "Root element not found" - HTML issue
   - Network errors - resource loading issue
   - React errors - component issue

### 4. Common Fixes:

**White Square Issue:**
- Extension needs reload after build
- Clear browser cache: Ctrl+Shift+Delete â†’ Cached images and files

**No Content:**
- Check if popup.js is loading
- Verify popup.css exists in dist/popup/
- Make sure React is mounting properly

**Styling Issues:**
- CSS file might be cached
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R on extensions page

### 5. Manual Test
Open `/Users/junzhao/workspace/apps/spblocker/debug-popup.html` in Chrome directly to test if popup works outside extension context.

### 6. Complete Reinstall (Last Resort)
1. Remove extension from Chrome
2. Delete `dist` folder
3. Run `npm run build`
4. Load unpacked extension again from fresh `dist` folder

## What Should Happen:
âœ… Popup opens to 340x400px size
âœ… Shows "Clean Amazon Search" header
âœ… Displays filter controls
âœ… Smooth animations
âœ… Responsive to clicks

## Debug Commands:
```bash
# Rebuild fresh
npm run clean && npm run build

# Check dist structure
ls -la dist/popup/

# Verify files are correct size
du -h dist/popup/*
```

The popup should now work properly after reloading the extension!
