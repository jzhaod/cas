# 🔍 Testing Review Count Filter Fix

## The Fix Applied:
Enhanced review count parsing to handle:
- **9.5k** → 9,500 reviews
- **12k** → 12,000 reviews  
- **1.2m** → 1,200,000 reviews
- **1,234** → 1,234 reviews (with commas)
- **500** → 500 reviews (regular numbers)

## To Test:

### 1. Reload Extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Refresh "Clean Amazon Search"

### 2. Test Review Filter
1. Go to Amazon search: https://www.amazon.com/s?k=laptop
2. Open extension popup
3. Set **Min Reviews** to **5000** (move slider to ~250 position)
4. Products with "9.5k" reviews should now **stay visible**
5. Products with "2.3k" reviews should be **hidden**

### 3. Check Console Logs
1. On Amazon page: Press F12 → Console tab
2. Look for logs like: `📊 Review count parsed: "9.5k" → 9500`
3. Verify conversions are working correctly

### 4. Test Different Formats
Search for different products to test:
- **Electronics**: Products often have "12k", "25k" format
- **Books**: Usually regular numbers "1,234"
- **Popular items**: May have "1.2m" format

### 5. Expected Behavior:
✅ **"9.5k reviews"** = 9,500 → Should pass 5000 filter
✅ **"2.3k reviews"** = 2,300 → Should be filtered out
✅ **"15k reviews"** = 15,000 → Should stay visible
✅ **"800 reviews"** = 800 → Should be filtered out

The fix ensures proper number conversion for all Amazon review count formats!
